#Read across workflow user guide

### The LRI AMBIT Read across tool
 
- **Online** at [https://ambitlri.ideaconsult.net](https://ambitlri.ideaconsult.net) 

Create your read across assessments online. The assessments are only visible to the owner by default, read/write access for other users are explicitly assigned. AMBIT uses role based access control.

- The user guide is under development. Please consult the LRI Workshop on AMBIT and READ-ACROSS [**Video and slides**](http://cefic-lri.org/events/lri-workshop-on-ambit-and-read-across/)
